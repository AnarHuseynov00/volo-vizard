        <h2> Motivation for the project</h2>
        <p>After long years of financial research, it has been found that there is a considerable auto-correlation between market
        volatility from time frame {<b>t</b>} to {<b>t+1</b>}. This finding has been the main idea of this project. More 
        explicitly, the project aims to learn the underlying pattern of market Autocorrelation. Using the learnt pattern, it makes 
        prediction about the volatility of {<b>t+1</b>} using the return data of previous days.
